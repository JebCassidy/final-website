    Hello everyone and welcome to my world-famous joke website! Are you ready to laugh uncontrollably? Well you have probably come to the wrong place and
    that probably won't happen. I said the website was famous worldwide, but not what it was famous for. Unfotunately, my jokes are quite literally two 
    dimensional. Please enjoy my favorite three jokes below!
